              <p>"Once upon a time, hundreds of years ago, Charles I of England hosted a sumptuous state banquet for many of his friends and family. The meal, consisting of many delicacies of the day, had been simply superb but the "coup de grace" was yet to come. After much preparation, the King's french chef had concocted an apparently new dish. It was cold and resembled fresh- fallen snow but was much creamier and sweeter than any other after- dinner dessert. The guests were delighted, as was Charles, who summoned the cook and asked him not to divulge the recipe for his frozen cream. The King wanted the delicacy to be served only at the Royal table and offered the cook 500 pounds a year to keep it that way. Sometime later, however, poor Charles fell into disfavour with his people and was beheaded in 1649. But by that time, the secret of the frozen cream remained a secret no more. The cook, named DeMirco, had not kept his promise."</p>

        <h3>WHO INVENTED ICE CREAM?</h3>
        <p>Good question! No one knows. The title of official ice cream inventor has never been awarded. What we do know is, as far back as 200 B.C., people have enjoyed variations of frozen treats. Alexander the Great loved snow flavoured with honey and nectar, biblical references have been made to King Solomon’s desire of iced drinks, and Nero Claudius Caesar was known to send servants to the mountains for snow to then be flavoured with fruits and juices. However, it is the Chinese who are most often credited with the invention of today’s ice cream. They figured out that packing snow into a bowl of rice and milk made a tasty treat. Then a thousand years later, Marco Polo returned home from a trip to the Far East with a recipe similar to modern day sherbet. The craze quickly spread throughout Europe’s upper class, and royalty during the 1500s. But that ice cream just kept on melting. So, there was no way for lower classes to keep their ice cream cold.</p>

        <h3>ICE CREAM COMES TO AMERICA</h3>
        <p>Ice cream officially made its way to America in 1744, when a Scottish colonist visited the Governor of Maryland and wrote about the “delicious strawberry ice cream” he had eaten there. From there ice cream invaded the White House, with presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, loving the treat on hot summer days. Yet, ice cream remained a dessert for the upper class.</p>

        <h3>ICE CREAM FOR THE MASSES</h3>
        <p>Finally in 1851 ice cream entered mass production. Jacob Fussell, a Pennsylvanian milk dealer, decided the demand for his products was too unstable. So, he opened an ice cream factory to make use of his unsold milk. The factory was an instant success! The mass production of ice cream suddenly made the treat more accessible to the lower classes. Then in the late 1800s, the industrial revolution hit! Advances in refrigeration, steam power, and automobiles finally made it possible for ice cream to be transported to and stored by the masses. In the 1930s, ice cream hit grocery store shelves and became a staple in American freezers. The popularity of ice cream grew to the point, where it was seen as a symbol of Americanism. So much so, that during the Second World War serving ice cream to the troops became a source of moral.</p>
